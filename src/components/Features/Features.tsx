            <p>
              The JavaScript ecosystem is exploding like uncontained diarrhea, and in the middle of that, the overall page size on the Web
              also increased. So you might think that websites will load slower than ever, shit will break, and we&apos;re inching one step
              closer to the heat death of the universe.

            <p>

              Even better than that, despite all of this newfangled ECMABabelFlowReasonTypeScript magic, you <em>can</em> still make things

              If your site has got a bunch of CSS shoved into it, <strong>only load what&apos;s critical for the page</strong>, and inline

              <p>
                I&apos;m gonna level with you. I&apos;m suffering from a rare health condition known as &quot;CSS-itis&quot;. It prevents me
                from doing productive shit with, and even touching a single line of CSS, if I could help it. I never thought I would see the
                light of day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here&apos;s a solution: CSS-in-JS. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but hear me out. Designing through CSS is already a
                pain in the ass, especially with globally-scoped classes that will be happy to fuck you over when your CSS gets large. Thank
                fuck for{' '}

                </a>
                , which takes your existing CSS and solves all of the scoping issues through some JS magic. There&apos;s also a lot of other
                options, like{' '}

              <p>
                So here you go, all the goodness of CSS-in-JS, rolled into this very page. Beautiful typography. And alignment. Also,
                light-coloured backgrounds are for losers. I like it dark. It&apos;s edgy as fuck. Plus, it doesn&apos;t hurt your fucking
                eyes when you&apos;re looking at this beauty for 16 hours straight.
