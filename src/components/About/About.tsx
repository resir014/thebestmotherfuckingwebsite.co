        If you look at the granddaddies of motherfucking websites,{' '}

        whereas I, a third-world country peasant, would cry tears of actual joy if true broadband

        fucking issue, and that the existence of JavaScript has become a bane to humanity&apos;s
        shitty existence, yet forgot that web performance is something that requires some TLC and
        actual fucking effort, and all of the page bloat hoohah doesn&apos;t even matter as much
        anymore.

        This is where <em>The Best Motherfucking Website</em> ― <strong>TBMFW</strong> ― comes in.
        To prove all you fuckers wrong, plus it also works as an eye bleach.
