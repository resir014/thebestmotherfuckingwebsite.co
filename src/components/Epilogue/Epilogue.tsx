        I&apos;m gonna end this motherfucking rant with some positivity. My point is, yes, it&apos;s true that the{' '}

        . Sure, websites are getting more and more bloated. But all of these matter less than what they used to be. In fact, the developers
        of No Man&apos;s Sky tried to make their procedurally-generated game as small as they can. Look how well that turned out.

      <p>
        This whole increase in size is natural, but also, recent innovation in web development has made it easier to make your codebase less
        shit. When one door closes, another one opens wide. What matters is how can you optimize for that sweet, sweet Lighthouse score,
        that sweet, sweet first meaningful paint (FMP) time. Be it by code splitting, preloading your essentials, lazyloading your shit, or
        whatever kind of black magic you came up with. I don&apos;t care, it&apos;s your app. I don&apos;t make the rules.

        , <strong>the language itself is hardly an issue</strong>. Any bad developer can take any platform/ecosystem and shit on it. But
        amongst the dark alleyways filled with piles of shit, there&apos;s still a majority of people trying their hardest to make things
        better for everyone.
